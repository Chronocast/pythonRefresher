# The pound sign is used as a comment character in Python. Programmers
# use comments to annotate code. Python ignores everything after the
# comment character on a line.

# Notice how the 'print' command has been inserting a new line at the
# end of our strings.
print("The last three mayors of Philadelphia were:")

# We can insert newlines ourselves, using "\n".
print("Michael Nutter\nJohn Street\nEd Rendell\nObama Biden")

# "" Is the empty string. Since the print command will insert a
# newline at the end, this will print a newline by itself:
print("")

# Here's a new kind of printing: you can use triple quotes to create
# multiline strings.
print("""Jim Kenney was elected Mayor
of Philadelphia on November 3, 2015, beating
Republican challenger Melissa Murray Bailey.""")

print("")

# When you use triple quotes, whitespace is preserved.
print("""Jim Kenney received
    84% of the
        popular vote""")
